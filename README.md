# Tech-Academy-Live-Project
Custom web scraping application built with Django and Beautifulsoup.  The application gathers data from the web that is relevant to the user (localized weather, and personalized sports, entertainment, and tech news).  Other technologies used include:

* Selenium (Python Library)
* Virtualenv (Python Library)
* Visual Studio Code
* Azure DevOps (Project Management)
* Git (Source Control)

Specific contributions during my 2 weeks working on the development team include code to:

1. [Retrieve current local weather](docs/Local_Weather.pdf) info (temperature, humidity and date:time of update) within the zipcode of the user.
2. Display the [three-day forecast](docs/Three_Day_Forecast.pdf) of local weather within the zipcode of the user.
3. Create a [model for messages](docs/Message_Model.pdf) within a new application of the DataScrape project to store sender/receiver names, date, and message body text.
4. Display the [NASA image](docs/NASA_Image.pdf) of the day (APOD), along with its title, and descriptive text.
5. Retrieve the current [top 5 box office movie titles](docs/Movies.pdf).
6. [Automatically populate the HockeyTeam model](docs/NHL_Teams_Script.pdf) in the DataApp of the DataScrape project with all of the current NHL team names.
7. Save the [favorite NHL team](docs/NHL_Team.pdf) to the user's personal profile management page.
8. Display the [next five events](docs/Events.pdf) for the user's favorite NHL team.
9. Display the [logo of the user's favorite NHL team](Logo.pdf) on the user's sports page.
