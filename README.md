# Tech-Academy-Live-Project
Custom web scraping application built with Django and Beautifulsoup.  The application gathers data from the web that is relevant to the user (localized weather, and personalized sports, entertainment, and tech news).  Other technologies used include:

* Selenium (Python Library)
* Virtualenv (Python Library)
* Visual Studio Code
* Azure DevOps (Project Management)
* Git (Source Control)

Specific contributions during my 2 weeks working on the development team include code to:

1. Retrieve current local weather info (temperature, humidity and date:time of update) within the zipcode of the user.
2. Display the three-day forecast of local weather within the zipcode of the user.
3. Create a model for messages within a new application of the DataScrape project to store sender/receiver names, date, and message body text.
4. Display the NASA image of the day (APOD), along with its title, and descriptive text.
5. Retrieve the current top 5 box office movie titles.
6. Save the favorite NHL team to the user's personal profile management page.
7. [Automatically populate the HockeyTeam model](NHL_Teams_Script.pdf) in the DataApp of the DataScrape project with all of the current NHL team names.
8. Display the logo of the user's favorite NHL team on the user's sports page.
9. Display the next five events for the user's favorite NHL team.
